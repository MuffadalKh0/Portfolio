## Here's my Story for this "Application"

# You can skip this if want ;)


## My Long Story on how this came into being
Okay this was in 2018. I was learning Javascript from Sir. Muhammad Ali Mughal in a Bohra Community program. He recommended us to practice coding from this site called [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (he also promised rewards for anyone who did :). The practices were divided into groups that had sub-groups i.e there was a frontend group that contained sub-groups like HTML, CSS, etc. So at the end of the frontend group their was a sub-group called "Responsive Web Design Projects" that had creative projects that encapsulated everything that you learned in the group, it was like a final battle where you had to prove that you're worthy for a certificate (at the completion of a group, you got an certificate). So then one of these projects included making a "Portfolio".

One thing to note is that i took these little projects very seriously and gave them my up most creative time. I completed these projects and got my certificate for the "Responsive Web Design Certification" that took 300 hours. I was happy and this was the end of the story of that time but as you will see these little projects came in handy when i learned a new web technology called "React".

So react, this was in January 2019. I was learning React form [Sir. Yousuf Qutbuddin](https://github.com/uqutub) in the same program. The program unfortunately ended for many reasons. We were left on learning react on our own and i did. I tried three times and i failed in every single attempt. I couldn't continue. Every bit of enthusiasm had ended and board exams were on the corner. 

I still tried anyway, at my fourth try i perfectly knew what i wanted to do and how i wanted to do it. I gave it my whole day and everything seemed to work. At the end of the day i was left with a fully working React Application using my old code. I gave it another day to refine my code and hosted it to GitHub!

So what did we learn?<br>
*Play attention to little things<br>
*Don't go to react with a empty mind<br>
*Don't give up<br>


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
